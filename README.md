<p>
  I specialize in pixel art media, such as profile pictures, video game textures, or short animations.
  
  I have over three years of pixel art and graphic design experience, and have been doing commission work for over two of those. Client feedback and transparency is central to my services, and I only charge what you can pay.
  
  If you are interested in commissioning me, please let me know via Discord by clicking the link on the left and sending a friend request. We can then proceed in direct messages.

<p>
  Faithful is a collection of open source and community-driven Minecraft resource packs, aiming to provide a higher-resolution version of the default Minecraft textures while staying true to the originals.

  I'm a co-owner and manager of the project, and have been involved for over two years in its development. I help with [website](https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/Website) development, [Discord bot](https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/CompliBot) development, [texture making](https://docs.faithfulpack.net/pages/manuals/contributor-handbook), and much more.

  You can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sN9YRQbBv7) to help us contribute to the project, give feedback, or just generally chat with us, or click the image on the right to view our website.

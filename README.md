<p>
  Faithful is a collection of open source and community-driven Minecraft resource packs, aiming to provide a higher-resolution version of the default Minecraft textures while staying true to the originals.

  I'm a co-owner and manager of the project, and have been involved for over two years in its development. I help with [website](https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/Website) development, [Discord bot](https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/Discord-Bot) development, [texture making](https://docs.faithfulpack.net/pages/textures/contributor-handbook), and much more.

  You can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sN9YRQbBv7) to help us contribute to the project, give feedback, or just generally chat with us, or click the image on the left to view our website.

<p>
  spunch bot is a general-purpose Discord bot, featuring per-server custom prefixes, an intuitive feedback ticket system, global announcements from a customizable whitelist, and much more.
  
  Started in October 2022 as a hobby project of my own using the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) framework, mostly as a joke, anyone can now run it by simply forking the repository and following the instructions in the README.
  
  You can click the image on the right to get started with cloning and installing the bot anywhere.

<p>
  I do commissions for small-scale pixel art work, such as Minecraft skins, textures, and profile pictures. They'll generally cost between 5-10 USD, depending on complexity and time required.
  
  I have well over two years of pixel art and graphic design experience under my belt, and have been doing commission work for nearly one and a half years. I prioritize client feedback above all and ensure maximum transparency throughout the designing process.
  
  If you are interested in commissioning me, please let me know via Discord by clicking the link on the left and sending a friend request. We can then proceed in direct messages.
